                Keith Farazzi echoes Trevor Noah in his book Who's Got Your Back: The Four Mind-Sets of a Successful Leader with the idea that one way to ensure success in college is that you must figure out whom it is that you find supportive, especially when you need a little help every now and then, whether it be emotionally, physically, or spiritually. Hopefully, you can think of someone in your personal circle that will be there for you when you're at a low point in your life. This person may be the one you can call (or text) if you're feeling stressed during the semester, even if just to vent or complain. Cherish that person! 
            </p>
            <p>
                As far as it concerns your being in my class this semester, you can readily assume that I will have your back. If you need help, please let me know. At least as long as you're my student, I will do all I can to help you achieve success!
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, here are a bunch of on-campus resources (with hyperlinks) to help you throughout the semester!
